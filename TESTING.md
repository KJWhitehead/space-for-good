## Bugs

**Fixed Bugs**

- The pages bookings.html and edit_booking.html within the Facilities app did not have "Facilities" as active in the navbar.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I changed the class to: "text-white nav-link {% if 'facilities/' in request.path %}active{% endif %}".

- The view booking function was not displaying the booking in date and time order, making for bad UX.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I added: |dictsort:"time"|dictsort:"date".

- During this project, even with whitenoise installed, static was not automatically collected.

    - To fix this, I ran the collectstatic command in terminal.
